s**tash** content that you can access later.

ü§î Motivation
---

Every now and then, I find myself accessing some piece of string content (a
`curl` request, a shell command, or literally anything else) several times over
a period of time. While modern clipboard managers help in recalling previously
copied data, they require some searching. I needed a command line tool that
would make saving and querying string content quick and easy. So, I wrote
`tash`.

üíæ Installation
---

**cargo**:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/dhth/tash.git
```

echo -n "some content" | tash push key

cat << EOF | tash push key
Multi line
content goes
here.
EOF

# push content to tash from a file

# push content to tash from system clipboard
tash push key -c

# get content from tash
tash get key

# get content from tash and copy to system clipboard
tash get key -c

# get content from tash and only copy to system clipboard
tash get key -c --no-output

# get content from tash and remove it from its store
tash get key --pop

# list content saved to tash
tash ls

# delete content items
tash delete key1 key2 key3

# empty tash's store
tash empty
```

### Fetch content using fzf

The process of fetching content can be made easier by making use of a fuzzy
finder like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected_key=$(
    tash ls |
        fzf \
            --reverse \
            --preview 'tash get {}' \
            --preview-window=right:70% \
            --preview-border=vertical \
            --border=none
)

if [ -z "$selected_key" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

tash get "${selected_key}" -nc
```

### Delete multiple entries using fzf

Same for deletion for content.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected_keys=$(
    tash ls |
        fzf \
            --multi \
            --reverse \
            --preview 'tash get {}' \
            --preview-window=right:70% \
            --preview-border=vertical \
            --border=none |
        xargs
)

if [ -z "$selected_keys" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

tash delete ${selected_keys}
```
