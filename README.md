`tash` s**tash**es content that you can access later.

ü§î Motivation
---

Every now and then, I find myself accessing some piece of string content (a
`curl` request, a shell command, or literally anything else) several times over
a period of time. While modern clipboard managers help in recalling previously
copied data, they require some searching. I needed a command line tool that
would make saving and querying string content quick and easy. So, I wrote
`tash`.

üíæ Installation
---

**cargo**:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/dhth/tash.git
```

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

### Help

```text
Usage: tash <COMMAND>

Commands:
  d     Delete one or more content items
  e     Empty entire stash
  ls    List stashed content keys
  g     Get content from stash
  p     Push content to stash
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# push content to tash from stdin
echo -n "some content" | tash p key

cat << EOF | tash p key
Multi line
content goes
here.
EOF

# push content to tash from a file
tash p key -f path/to/file.txt

# push content from a flag
tash p key -d "content goes here"

# push content while preventing overwrites
tash p key -d "content goes here" -p

# push content to tash from system clipboard
tash p key -c

# get content from tash
tash g key

# get content from tash and copy to system clipboard
tash g key -c

# get content from tash and only copy to system clipboard
tash g key -c --no-output

# get content from tash and remove it from its store
tash g key --pop

# list content saved to tash
tash ls

# delete content items
tash d key1 key2 key3

# empty tash's store
tash e
```

### Fetch content using fzf

The process of fetching content can be made easier by making use of a fuzzy
finder like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected_key=$(tash ls | fzf)

if [ -z "$selected_key" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

tash g "${selected_key}" -nc
```

### Delete multiple entries using fzf

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected_keys=$(tash ls | fzf --multi | xargs)

if [ -z "$selected_keys" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

tash d ${selected_keys}
```
