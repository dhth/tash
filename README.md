`tash` "stashes" content that you can access later.

ü§î Motivation
---

Every now and then, I find myself accessing some piece of string content (a
`curl` request, a shell command, or literally anything else) several times over
a period of time. While modern clipboard managers help in recalling previously
copied data, they require some searching. I needed a command line tool that
would make saving and querying string content quick and easy. So, I wrote
`tash`.

üíæ Installation
---

**cargo**:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/dhth/tash.git
```
